# MAP569-datachallenge: Who are the high-frequency traders ? 

## Challenge context
Financial markets are made up of various types of market players, each with specific interests and hence heterogeneous behaviours. For regulators, it is important to know the different types of market players in order to better understand how their behaviour has an impact on the market. 

## Challenge goals
The goal of the challenge is to classify traders within three categories, HFT, non HFT and MIX.
